I am currently a Director Emerita at the CNRS.  I was a Director of Research in the CNRS in France and director o f a fundamental biology research laboratory (LBPA) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay from 2011 to the end of 2019.

Following a PhD in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis with Pr. Roger Epton at Wolverhampton Polytechnic in the UK (1980), I held a series of post-doctoral positions in Canada, Italy and France and finally became a senior scientist at the CNRS working with Dr Henri Buc at the Pasteur Institute Paris.  After moving to the ENS Cachan, in 2002 I directed a group working on the control and regulation of transcription. Although my research interests covered a broad spectrum ranging from solid phase peptide synthesis through bioenergetics to the control of gene expression, I was always aware of the necessity of developing techniques that allow time-resolved analysis of dynamic systems. This led to the development and use of rapid high-energy UV lasers to follow the photo-reactivity of DNA involved in nucleoprotein complexes leading culminating in the PhAST (Photochemical Analysis of Structural Transitions) technique. I was an early user of emerging technologies based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPRi) and quickly realised that these techniques were severely limited by problems associated with the interface between a surface-based biosensor surface (a biochip) and macromolecules in solution. My group developed a unique surface chemistry for biosensor surfaces and nanoparticles with potential for use in diagnostic assays.

Current research interests are focused on the dynamics of nucleoprotein complexes, specifically nucleosomes and RNA polymerases. I am a self employed entrepreneur with my own consulting company (Malcolm Buckle Consulting)  working on biophysical aspects of macromolecular interactions.
